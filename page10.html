            <div class="parg2">Over the last decade, there has been a proliferation of companies offering alternatives to single-use cups for various settings such as offices, restaurants, cafes, events, and festivals. A circular shipping platform, introduced in May 2019, operates as a subscription-based e-commerce service for major brands like Unilever, Nestl√©, Proctor and Gamble, among others. The brand retains ownership of the packaging, making it in their best interest to ensure the packaging is as robust and durable as possible.

                Ooho, an edible and biodegradable packaging made from brown seaweed, serves as an eco-friendly alternative for beverages and condiments. In a trial with ten restaurants, 46,000 plastic sauce sachets were replaced. Additionally, at the 2019 London Marathon, Ooho capsules eliminated the need for over 30,000 single-use plastic cups and bottles. Moving from single-use to reuse not only helps eliminate plastic waste and pollution but also, if done well, offers significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other negative externalities.
